# Bootstrap Cheat Sheet

You can use this cheat sheet to pull and customize Bootstrap components for your projects

## Getting Started

* Create a folder called Bootstrap Cheat Sheet
* Create an index.html inside that folder you just created
* Copy HTML5 Starter Template from Bootstrap’s website and paste it into your index.html file -  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template
* Download Compiled CSS and JS - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/
* Add the css folder inside the Bootstrap Cheat Sheet folder
* Inside the css folder you just downloaded, keep bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.css, delete the rest of the css files
* You can view bootstrap.css to see all of the css styles. This is where you can customize any elements if you’re unhappy with Bootstrap’s styling
* We’ll be using bootstrap.min.css for this example
* We don’t need the JS folder for this example
* Comments will tell you where to find these items in Bootstrap’s documentation page
